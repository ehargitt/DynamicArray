# DynamicArray
A dynamically resizing array. When it reaches 50% capacity, it doubles in length. I tried to follow the Google C++ coding standards, so if you see something that isn't correct according to their [guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html "Google C++ Style Guide"), please change it.
